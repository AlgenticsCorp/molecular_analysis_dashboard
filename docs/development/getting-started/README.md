## ‚ùì **Common Questions**

### **"Where should I start?"**
Start with the [Setup Guide](setup.md) to get your environment working, then read the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand the system design.

### **"I'm new to Clean Architecture. Help?"**
The [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) explains our specific implementation with examples. Also check our [Developer Guide](../guides/developer-guide.md) for detailed patterns.

### **"How do I find something to work on?"**
Check the [First Contribution](first-contribution.md) guide for finding good starter issues. Look for `good-first-issue` labels on GitHub.

### **"Tests are failing. What do I do?"**
First, ensure your environment is set up correctly using the [Setup Guide](setup.md). Then check our troubleshooting section in the [Developer Guide](../guides/developer-guide.md).

### **"How do I debug the application?"**
