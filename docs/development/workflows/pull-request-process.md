git fetch origin
git checkout feature/MOL-123-new-feature

# Run tests locally
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit

# Test the feature manually
docker compose up -d
# Navigate to http://localhost and test (gateway route)
# Alternative: http://localhost:3000 for direct frontend access
```

#### 2. Review Checklist

#### 3. Feedback Guidelines

**Types of Comments:**
- **Nitpick**: Minor style/preference issues (non-blocking)
- **Question**: Clarification needed (non-blocking)
- **Suggestion**: Improvement recommendation (non-blocking)
- **Issue**: Must be addressed before merge (blocking)
- **Blocker**: Critical issue that prevents merge (blocking)

**Comment Examples:**
```markdown
# Good feedback
**Issue**: This function could cause a memory leak because it doesn't close the database connection.

**Suggestion**: Consider extracting this logic into a separate service class for better testability.

**Nitpick**: Variable name could be more descriptive (e.g., `user_molecules` instead of `data`).

**Question**: Is this endpoint backward compatible with existing clients?
```

#### 4. Approval Guidelines
- **Approve**: All requirements met, ready to merge
- **Request Changes**: Blocking issues that must be addressed
- **Comment**: Feedback provided but not blocking merge

### For Authors

#### Responding to Feedback
1. **Address all feedback**: Respond to every comment
2. **Make requested changes**: Fix all blocking issues
3. **Ask for clarification**: If feedback is unclear
4. **Update PR description**: If scope changes significantly
5. **Re-request review**: After making substantial changes

#### Comment Resolution
```markdown
# Addressing feedback
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated the function to properly close database connections.

‚ùì **Question**: Could you clarify what you mean by "more descriptive"?

üí≠ **Acknowledged**: I'll create a follow-up issue to refactor this into a service class.

üîÑ **Updated**: Changed variable name to `user_molecules` as suggested.
```

# GitHub will:
# 1. Create merge commit preserving branch history
# 2. Tag with version number
# 3. Trigger production deployment
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves development history
- Clear release boundaries
- Supports semantic versioning

### Post-merge Actions

#### Automatic
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Triggers deployment to appropriate environment
- **Branch Cleanup**: Feature branches automatically deleted
- **Issue Updates**: Related issues marked as resolved
- **Notifications**: Team notified via Slack/email

#### Manual

## Troubleshooting

### Common PR Issues

#### "Checks are failing"
1. Check the specific failing check in PR status
2. Run the same check locally to debug
3. Fix the issue and push new commits
4. Checks will re-run automatically

#### "Merge conflicts"
```bash
# Update your branch with target branch
git checkout your-feature-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/dev  # or origin/main

# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

#### "Missing required reviews"
- Request reviews from team members
- Address any blocking feedback
- Ping reviewers if urgent
- Check if you need specific reviewer types (architect, security, etc.)

#### "Branch protection violations"
- Ensure all required status checks pass
- Get the required number of approving reviews
- Update branch to be current with target
- Check for any custom protection rules

### Review Best Practices

#### For Large PRs
- Break into smaller, focused PRs when possible
- Provide detailed description and context
- Schedule sync review session for complex changes
- Consider draft PR for early feedback

#### For Urgent Fixes
- Label PR as "urgent" or "hotfix"
- Ping specific reviewers immediately
- Provide extra context about urgency
- Fast-track review process with senior approval

#### For Architecture Changes
- Create design document first
- Get architecture review before implementation
- Include performance and scalability considerations
- Document migration strategy
