## Quick Navigation

### **For Architects**
1. Start with [System Overview](overview.md) for high-level understanding
2. Review [Clean Architecture](clean-architecture.md) for implementation patterns
3. Examine [Use Cases](use-cases.md) for business context
4. Study [Code Structure](code-structure.md) for implementation guidance

### **For Developers**
1. Understand [Clean Architecture](clean-architecture.md) principles
2. Review [Code Structure](code-structure.md) for organization patterns
3. Check [Framework Design](framework-design.md) for technical context
4. Reference [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md) for detailed patterns

### **For Technical Leads**
1. Review [Design Overview](design-overview.md) for comprehensive understanding
2. Analyze [Use Cases](use-cases.md) for business alignment
3. Evaluate [Architecture Documentation](architecture.md) for implementation details
4. Plan using [Framework Design](framework-design.md) for technical roadmap

### Key Principles
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies point inward toward business logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Testability**: All layers can be tested in isolation

## Best Practices

### Architecture Reviews
- Conduct architecture reviews for significant changes
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Maintain architectural consistency across modules
- Regular architecture health checks and refactoring

### Design Evolution
- Evolve architecture incrementally based on requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
- Document breaking changes and migration strategies
- Align architecture changes with business priorities
