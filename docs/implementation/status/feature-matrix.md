## 🎯 **Feature Dependencies**

### **Critical Path Dependencies**
1. **Phase 3B** → **Phase 3C**: Security must be implemented before production
2. **Phase 3B** → **Phase 4A**: Service layer needed for task integration
3. **Phase 4A** → **Phase 4B**: Task framework required for engine integration
4. **Phase 4B** → **Phase 4C**: Engines needed for advanced pipelines

### **Parallel Development Opportunities**
- **Phase 3C & 3D**: Can be developed simultaneously
- **Phase 4B engines**: Different engines can be implemented in parallel
- **Documentation & Testing**: Can proceed alongside feature development

---

## 📈 **Progress Tracking Guidelines**

### **Status Definitions**
- **✅ Complete**: Feature fully implemented, tested, and documented
- **🔄 In Progress**: Active development underway
- **🏗️ Ready to Start**: Prerequisites met, ready for development
- **⏳ Not Started**: Waiting for dependencies or not yet prioritized
- **🚫 Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- **⚠️ At Risk**: Development challenges or timeline concerns

### **Update Frequency**
- **Daily**: Individual feature status updates by developers
- **Weekly**: Phase progress reviews and planning adjustments
- **Monthly**: Overall project status and milestone assessments

### **Quality Gates**
Each feature must meet these criteria before marking as complete:
- [ ] Code implementation finished
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Performance requirements met
