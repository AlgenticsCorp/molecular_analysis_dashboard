## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GitHub Project Board

1. Go to your organization/repository
2. Create new Project (use Board template)
3. Add custom fields:
   - **Status**: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Testing, Done, Cancelled
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
   - **Size**: XS, Small, Medium, Large, XL
   - **Area**: Backend, Frontend, Infrastructure, Documentation, Testing

### 2. Update Workflow Configuration

Edit workflow files to match your project:
- Update `project-url` in workflows to point to your project
- Adjust team assignments in `project-automation.yml`
- Customize field names if different from defaults

### 3. Initialize Project Labels

Run the "Project Board Management" workflow with "initialize" action to:
- Create all standard labels
- Set up label color coding
- Prepare repository for automation

## Usage

### Automatic Operations

Once configured, these operations happen automatically:

1. **New Issues**: Added to project with auto-detected labels
2. **New PRs**: Added to project with size/area labels  
3. **PR Reviews**: Status updated (needs-review â†’ approved/changes-requested)
4. **Closures**: Items moved to "Done" status
5. **Team Assignment**: Based on area labels

### Manual Operations

Trigger manual operations via GitHub Actions:

- **Sync**: Add missing items to project board
- **Cleanup**: Remove closed items from board
- **Initialize**: Create standard labels and setup

## Testing

Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/test_project_automation.py`:

- Validates YAML syntax of all workflows
- Checks workflow structure and required jobs
- Verifies issue templates exist and have proper format
- Ensures PR template has required sections
- Confirms documentation completeness

## Benefits

### For Project Managers
- **Real-time visibility** into project status
- **Automated progress tracking** without manual updates
- **Consistent labeling** across all items
- **Team workload distribution** through auto-assignment

### For Developers

## Customization

The system is designed to be highly customizable:

### Adding New Areas
1. Add area labels to `project-board-management.yml`
2. Update detection logic in `issue-pr-lifecycle.yml`
3. Add team assignments in `project-automation.yml`

### Modifying Status Flow
1. Update status mappings in workflows
2. Adjust field values to match your project setup
3. Test changes with draft PRs

### Integration Extensions
