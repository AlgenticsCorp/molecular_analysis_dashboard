## üß™ Reproduction Steps

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Commands to set up test environment
docker compose up -d postgres redis
docker compose up -d api worker
```

### Load Generation
```bash
# Example load test command
curl -X POST /api/v1/molecules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@large_molecule.sdf"
```

**Test Data:**
- Molecule file size: `[X]MB`
- Number of concurrent users: `[X]`
- Test duration: `[X]` minutes
- Molecular complexity: `[atoms/bonds count]`

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Commands used to monitor during testing
docker stats
docker compose logs api -f
top -p $(pgrep -f "celery worker")
```

## üéØ Performance Targets

### Target Metrics
**API Response Times:**
- Molecule upload: < 2s for 10MB files
- Docking job submission: < 500ms
- Results retrieval: < 1s for 100 results
- Authentication: < 100ms

**Throughput Requirements:**
- Concurrent users: 100+
- Molecules processed: 50/hour per worker
- API requests: 1000/second sustained

**Resource Limits:**
- Memory per container: < 1GB
- CPU per container: < 2 cores under normal load
- Database connections: < 50 per API instance

### Business Impact
