# Implementation Plan (Enhanced with Dynamic Task System)

This plan ensures the system is runnable at the end of every stage. Each stage defines a small goal, strict scope, quality gates, and rollback. **Enhanced to include dynamic task system for scalable computational workflows.**

Deployment steps per stage live in:
- Local (Compose): `project_design/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_LOCAL.md`
- Cloud (VM/Kubernetes outline): `project_design/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN_CLOUD.md`

References: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FRAMEWORK_DESIGN.md`, `API_CONTRACT.md`, `ERD.md`, `SCHEMA_PROPOSAL.md`, `DATABASES.md`.
